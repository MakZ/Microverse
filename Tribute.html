          <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of
              Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
              "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
              Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
              how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry
              Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due
              to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
              school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor
              attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
              work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,
              and other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li>
              <b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind
              his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
              pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
              different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
              varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling
              wheat yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
              high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
              to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat
              to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass
              starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
            </li>
            <li>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li>
              <b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their
              maize and sorghum yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by
              2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
              can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
              crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
              called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
            </li>
            <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
            contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
            scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
            <br />
